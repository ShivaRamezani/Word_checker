# Word_checker


This program checks if the entered word exist in the word list file provided. That is why it is called word checker!



Data structures used:
1- Binary search tree
2- AVL tree
3- Hash table


Based on our result Hash Table has the best run-time efficiency. The AVL tree was 
the worst. 
Hash Table > BST > AVL Tree
Theoretically, AVL tree has a better run-time complexity than BST, but for random 
access data, hash tables are superior to both trees, also the given data is not 
dynamic and it is unsorted. Therefore, the runtime result in this algorithm is 
opposite


Instruction to run the code:
To run the code, the c plus plus file should be in the same directory as data files.
That is why we put one of the data files within the source code file.
